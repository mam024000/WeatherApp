# WeatherApp  
A SpringBoot application that includes a weather module with sensors, a web site and a database.  The weather app takes regular readings and sends the readings to the REST controller for storage into the database.  The data will be available for viewing on the web site.  Future iterations will include machine learning modules to attempt to forecast the weather.
